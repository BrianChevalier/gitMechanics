\section{How the Website is Compiled}

Jekyll is a blog-aware static site generator. Github supports hosting websites with custom domains using the Jekyll blogging platform. The major benefit to this (other than that it is free), is that anytime the master branch of the github repo is updated via a commit, github automatically rebuilds the site using Jekyll and makes it live. This is great because all of the source documents can be stored in the same repository as the source files that build the website. It also has the added benefit of automatically rebuilding itself if someone makes a pull request on the repo and it is accepted.
