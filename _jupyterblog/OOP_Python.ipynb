Those properties can be adjusted through various functions that are applied to that object type (those are called methods). A *class* is the template that each object is based on. This is really abstract and doesn't make sense without some solid examples. So let's jump into an example."

To define a node we need an `x` and a `y` coordinate. The keyword `self` is a reference to the object that the `Node` class creates. We then say that the object takes `x` and defines it as an attribute of the object it*self*. The same occurs with `y`."

    "This has been a pretty quick look at what object-oriented programming can do for structural analysis. This particular use is what convinced me to learn it and help me understand why it is important. The classes I have defined here are relatively simple, but they can easily scale. For instance, each node could have an associated nodal cost. Each member could have its own cross section (and each cross section type have their own attributes and derived attributes), and element stiffness. These could all be then built into a `Structure` class."
